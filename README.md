## üê≥ Docker Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vincentbui21/SmartJuiceSystem.git
cd SmartJuiceSystem
```
Build and start containers:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Access the apps:

```bash
Frontend (Vite) ‚Üí http://localhost:5173
Backend (API) ‚Üí http://localhost:5001
```
Stop containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```
‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables (Optional)
You can create a .env file in the backend folder to configure optional features like AWS SNS:
```env
# AWS SNS configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
SNS_TOPIC_ARN=
AWS_REGION=
DEFAULT_SMS_COUNTRY_CODE=+358
```
These are entirely optional. The system will work fully without them ‚Äî SMS notifications and auto-label printing will simply be disabled.
üëâ If AWS SNS or the industrial printer aren‚Äôt available, the system still works ‚Äî just without SMS and auto-printing.

## üîÑ Workflow Summary
1. Login: Use the employee account (employee / employee123) to access the system.
2. Add a New Customer: Enter customer details ‚Üí generate crate QR codes.
3. Crate Scanning: Scan crates ‚Üí order moves to juice processing.
4. Juice Processing: Fill pouches ‚Üí generate box QR codes ‚Üí send to printer (optional).
5. Load Boxes ‚Üí Pallet: Scan boxes ‚Üí assign to pallets.
6. Load Pallet ‚Üí Shelf: Scan pallets ‚Üí assign to shelves ‚Üí SMS notification sent (if configured).
7. Pickup Coordination: Search by customer ‚Üí mark orders as picked up.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
The system is fully functional even without:

* Industrial printer ‚Üí no auto-label printing
* AWS SNS ‚Üí no SMS notifications

Alternative database setups are supported (local PostgreSQL/MySQL).

## üóÉÔ∏èDatabase Setup

Before running the backend, the database will be automatically initialized by Docker using the files in Database/.
Optional: You can replace AWS RDS with any local PostgreSQL/MySQL instance if preferred.
